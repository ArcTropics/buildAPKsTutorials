Welcome to the source code for _Tuning Android Applications_!

All of the source code in this archive is licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license except as noted.

The names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a
shortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers
change with every release, and since some samples are used by
multiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the
actual directory names.

These projects are set up to be used with Eclipse or Ant. For use
with Ant, you should run
  `android update project -p ...`  (where ... is the path to a project of interest)
	on those projects you wish to use, so the build files are
	updated for your Android SDK version.
